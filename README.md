# Weather forecast

The project is developed using native JavaScript and it aims to display the weather forecast for the next 5 days based on the user's current location. The data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://api.openweathermap.org) using HTTP requests. The user's geolocation is retrieved to provide accurate weather information for their current location. The forecast data is then dynamically displayed on the webpage, providing users with a 5-day weather forecast for their location.
